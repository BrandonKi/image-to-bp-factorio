# BP UI directions

1. Run bp_ui.exe
2. Click "Open" and select an image of your choice, I reccommend choosing relatively small images
3. Click "Convert"
4. Click "Copy To Clipbord"
5. Paste blueprint string into factorio, depending on how big your image is this may take a while to import
6. Place blueprint

You can also just use the notebook if that's easier for you.
